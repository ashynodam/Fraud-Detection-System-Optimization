# Fraud-Detection-System

Detecting Fraudulent Transactions with Machine Learning 💻

In an era where digital transactions are booming, ensuring security has become a top priority. I'm excited to share my recent project on Credit Card Fraud Detection using advanced Machine Learning techniques. 🧠📊

Project Highlights:
Dataset: Analyzed anonymized credit card transaction data with features derived from PCA.
Techniques: Employed oversampling (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance and developed predictive models using:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier

Deployment: Successfully built and deployed a Flask-based API to predict transaction legitimacy in real-time.

Results:
Achieved high accuracy and precision scores, ensuring robust fraud detection.
Integrated the solution for scalable use with cloud/web hosting capabilities.

Tools & Technologies:
Python 🐍 (pandas, scikit-learn, Flask)
SMOTE for handling class imbalance
Flask / cPanel for deployment

🌟 Impact:
This project demonstrates how data-driven solutions can help combat financial fraud, protect users, and enhance trust in digital payment systems. 💳🔒
